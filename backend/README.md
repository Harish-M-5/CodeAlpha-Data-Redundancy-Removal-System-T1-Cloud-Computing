## FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.

<small>* estimation based on tests conducted by an internal development team, building production applications.</small>

## Alternative API docs upgrade

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

* The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

### Recap

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```Python
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```Python
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

* Editor support, including:
    * Completion.
    * Type checks.
* Validation of data:
    * Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    * JSON.
    * Path parameters.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies.
    * Headers.
    * Forms.
    * Files.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    * Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    * `datetime` objects.
    * `UUID` objects.
    * Database models.
    * ...and many more.
* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.
